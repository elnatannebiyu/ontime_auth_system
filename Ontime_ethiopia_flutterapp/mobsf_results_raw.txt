NO	ISSUE	SEVERITY	DESCRIPTION	OPTIONS
1 	App can be installed on a vulnerable unpatched Android version 7.0, [minSdk=24] 	high 	This application can be installed on an older version of android that has multiple unfixed vulnerabilities. These devices won't receive reasonable security updates from Google. Support an Android version => 10, API 29 to receive reasonable security updates. 	
2 	App has a Network Security Configuration[android:networkSecurityConfig=@xml/network_security_config] 	info 	The Network Security Configuration feature lets apps customize their network security settings in a safe, declarative configuration file without modifying app code. These settings can be configured for specific domains and for a specific app. 	
3 	Application Data can be Backed up [android:allowBackup] flag is missing. 	warning 	The flag [android:allowBackup] should be set to false. By default it is set to true and allows anyone to backup your application data via adb. It allows users who have enabled USB debugging to copy application data off of the device. 	
4 	Broadcast Receiver (io.flutter.plugins.firebase.messaging.FlutterFirebaseMessagingReceiver) is Protected by a permission, but the protection level of the permission should be checked. <strong>Permission: </strong>com.google.android.c2dm.permission.SEND [android:exported=true] 	warning 	A Broadcast Receiver is found to be shared with other apps on the device therefore leaving it accessible to any other application on the device. It is protected by a permission which is not defined in the analysed application. As a result, the protection level of the permission should be checked where it is defined. If it is set to normal or dangerous, a malicious application can request and obtain the permission and interact with the component. If it is set to signature, only applications signed with the same certificate can obtain the permission.

It is protected by a permission which is not defined in the analysed application. As a result, the protection level of the permission should be checked where it is defined. If it is set to normal or dangerous, a malicious application can request and obtain the permission and interact with the component. If it is set to signature, only applications signed with the same certificate can obtain the permission. 	
6 	Broadcast Receiver (com.google.firebase.iid.FirebaseInstanceIdReceiver) is Protected by a permission, but the protection level of the permission should be checked. <strong>Permission: </strong>com.google.android.c2dm.permission.SEND [android:exported=true] 	warning 	A Broadcast Receiver is found to be shared with other apps on the device therefore leaving it accessible to any other application on the device.
