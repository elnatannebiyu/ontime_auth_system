<h3>1.1 Background of the Organization</h3>
<p>AI TECHNOLOGIES PLC (ኤ አይ ቴክኖሎጂስ ኋላ/የተ/የግ/ማ) is an Ethiopian technology company that develops digital platforms supporting media, communication, and innovative services aligned with the country’s digital transformation efforts. The company provides scalable software and streaming solutions tailored for both local and regional audiences.</p>

<h3>1.2 Introduction</h3>
<p>This document outlines the technical and security-related details of the OnTime Ethiopia <strong>mobile application</strong>. It is prepared to support the Information Network Security Administration (INSA) in organizing and performing penetration testing and a comprehensive security review of the app.</p>
<p>It serves as a companion to the Web Application Testing and API Audit Information documents, which describe the associated backend APIs and web interface that the mobile app depends on.</p>

<h3>1.3 Objective</h3>
<p>The primary goal is to obtain an independent security assessment and certification for the OnTime Ethiopia mobile app. This assessment verifies that the application has been tested against common mobile and web-service vulnerabilities and ensures that any discovered issues can be addressed to strengthen the platform’s overall security posture.</p>

<h3>1.4 Business Architecture (Mobile App)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Product:</strong> OnTime Ethiopia – a mobile OTT/streaming application that provides live TV, shorts, and related content.</li>
  <li><strong>Core actors:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Mobile users (Android) accessing video content through the app.</li>
      <li>Backend services (Django REST API) delivering authentication, content metadata, and streaming URLs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Core backend:</strong> A Django REST Framework application exposing APIs for authentication, channels, live TV, playlist management, and shorts ingestion.</li>
  <li><strong>Mobile client:</strong> A Flutter-based Android application that interacts with these APIs over HTTPS.</li>
  <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> The mobile client connects to production or staging environments hosted by AI TECHNOLOGIES PLC; all communication with backend services is over TLS.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.5 Data Flow Diagram (Text Summary)</h3>
<ol>
  <li>The OnTime Ethiopia mobile app (Flutter client) communicates with the backend exclusively over HTTPS.</li>
  <li>The app authenticates users for restricted features such as login and account management, securely storing necessary tokens or session data.</li>
  <li>It submits REST API requests to the Django backend (for example, <code>/api/channels/</code>, <code>/api/live/</code>, <code>/api/channels/shorts/ready/feed/</code>, <code>/api/auth/login/</code>).</li>
  <li>The backend reads and writes data from the application database (e.g. PostgreSQL), including user accounts, live metadata, channels, playlists, and shorts processing jobs.</li>
  <li>For media playback, the backend returns HLS playlist URLs. The app then streams audio/video from CDN or streaming endpoints over HTTPS.</li>
  <li>If enabled, background analytics and error logs may transmit telemetry data to backend monitoring services.</li>
</ol>

<h3>1.6 Mobile Application Data Flow Diagram (PNG)</h3>
<p>A separate data flow diagram image is provided in the submission package. It visually shows the same flows described above, including the mobile client, backend API, database, CDN/streaming endpoints, and optional analytics/logging services.</p>

<h3>1.7 System Architecture Diagram with Database Relation (Text Summary)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Mobile Client Layer</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The OnTime Ethiopia Flutter app running on Android devices.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Application Layer</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Django REST API managing user authentication, authorization, content retrieval, and metadata for live streams and shorts.</li>
      <li>Celery workers handling tasks such as shorts ingestion, transcoding, and operational clean-up.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Data Layer</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>A relational database (e.g. PostgreSQL) storing user profiles, channels, playlists, shorts ingestion jobs, and live metadata.</li>
      <li>Object storage or a CDN hosting media files such as HLS playlists, thumbnails, and channel logos.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The mobile app never interacts directly with the database. All communication occurs through authenticated and authorized API calls.</p>

<h3>1.8 Native, Hybrid, and PWA Classification (Required)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Native Applications:</strong> The OnTime Ethiopia app is developed using Flutter and compiled into native Android binaries (APK/AAB). It uses native rendering and integrates with platform-specific components such as video playback plugins.</li>
  <li><strong>Hybrid Applications:</strong> The app is not a conventional hybrid application (for example, Cordova/PhoneGap) that renders the entire UI inside a WebView. It is a fully native-compiled Flutter app.</li>
  <li><strong>Progressive Web Apps (PWA):</strong> The OnTime Ethiopia mobile application is not a PWA and is distributed exclusively as a native, store-installed mobile app.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.9 Threat Model Overview</h3>
<p>We prepared a threat model for the OnTime Ethiopia mobile application focusing on the following elements:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Assets:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>User accounts and authentication credentials.</li>
      <li>Access tokens and session identifiers stored on the device.</li>
      <li>Streaming URLs and related metadata.</li>
      <li>App configurations and feature flags.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Threat examples:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Network traffic interception (Man-in-the-Middle) if HTTPS is misconfigured.</li>
      <li>Theft or compromise of sensitive information or stored tokens on the device.</li>
      <li>Unauthorized API usage or bypassing access controls through manipulated requests.</li>
      <li>Reverse engineering of the APK to reveal implementation details or API endpoints.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Mitigation examples:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Enforcement of HTTPS for all communication between the app and backend.</li>
      <li>Server-side authorization checks for all protected operations.</li>
      <li>Restricting and securing local storage of sensitive data, including minimal-duration tokens.</li>
      <li>Applying Flutter build obfuscation/minification to reduce reverse-engineering risks.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h3>2.2 Source Code or Binary (APK)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Source Code:</strong> The Flutter project is located in the repository directory (for example, <code>Ontime_ethiopia_flutterapp/</code>).</li>
  <li><strong>Binary:</strong> Testers will receive the Android APK build for installation on test devices. The official build may also be shared through a direct link or app store listing, depending on what is agreed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.3 Key Functionalities Requiring Detailed Testing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>User authentication and session lifecycle handling (login, logout, and token management).</li>
  <li>Secure interaction with API endpoints for live TV and shorts playback, including parameters and authorization.</li>
  <li>Behavior when encountering mixed or non-HTTPS media URLs, ensuring playback remains secure where possible.</li>
  <li>App behavior during network failures, backend downtime, or unexpected errors.</li>
  <li>Any hidden, debug, or configuration screens if they exist in the mobile client.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.4 Security and Compliance Requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Alignment with general mobile security best practices, including:
    <ul>
      <li>OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS) where applicable.</li>
      <li>Protection against common OWASP Mobile Top 10 risks (for example, insecure communication, weak authentication, and improper cryptography).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Safeguarding user data and credentials consistent with local expectations around privacy and data protection.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.5 Authentication Mechanisms Used in the Mobile Application</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Backend-driven authentication using credentials such as username/email and password, or social sign-in where enabled.</li>
  <li>The app securely stores required session tokens and includes them in subsequent API requests.</li>
  <li>A logout feature is available so users can terminate active sessions from within the app.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.6 Sensitive Data Stored or Transmitted by the Mobile Application</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Stored on the Device:</strong>

<h2>5. Additional Mandatory Requirements</h2>

<h3>5.1 System Architecture</h3>
<p>The OnTime Ethiopia mobile solution follows a modular architecture that clearly separates concerns across multiple layers:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Presentation layer:</strong> Flutter-based Android client responsible for UI, navigation, and basic input validation.</li>
  <li><strong>Application layer:</strong> Django REST API and Celery workers handling business logic, authentication, authorization, and content orchestration.</li>
  <li><strong>Data layer:</strong> PostgreSQL (or equivalent RDBMS) for structured data and object storage/CDN for media assets (HLS playlists, thumbnails, logos).</li>
  <li><strong>Integration layer:</strong> Connectors to external services such as YouTube/playlist sources, CDNs, and optional identity providers (e.g. Google).</li>
  <li><strong>Security layer:</strong> HTTPS/TLS, authentication/authorization, input validation, logging, and access control implemented primarily on the backend.</li>
  <li><strong>Monitoring layer:</strong> Application and infrastructure logs, error tracking, and basic metrics to observe system health.</li>
</ul>
<p>The architecture is designed to support scalable deployment on cloud or on-premises environments, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Horizontal scaling of application servers behind a load balancer.</li>
  <li>Containerization support for the backend and workers (e.g. Docker/Kubernetes) as part of CI/CD pipelines.</li>
  <li>High availability through redundant instances and database backup/restore procedures.</li>
  <li>Network segmentation between public-facing endpoints, application tier, and data stores.</li>
</ul>
<p>A complete infrastructure topology and deployment design (showing mobile clients, API gateways/load balancers, application servers, databases, storage, and monitoring components) can be provided in accompanying architecture diagrams and appendices.</p>

<h3>5.2 Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)</h3>
<p>The following data flow views are prepared for the mobile application:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Level-0 Context Diagram:</strong> Shows the OnTime Ethiopia mobile app as a single process interacting with external entities such as end users, backend API, streaming/CDN services, and authentication providers.</li>
  <li><strong>Level-1 High-Level DFD:</strong> Decomposes the mobile app and backend into major processes such as authentication, channel browsing, live TV playback, shorts feed, and account/profile management, including their data stores and external services.</li>
  <li><strong>Level-2 Detailed DFDs:</strong> Provide detailed flows for security-relevant processes (e.g. login, token storage/refresh, content playback requests, and audit logging), showing data sources, transformations, data stores, and sinks.</li>
</ul>
<p>These diagrams use standard notations to illustrate:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Authentication and authorization flows between the mobile app, backend, and identity providers.</li>
  <li>API interactions for channels, live TV, shorts, and profile data.</li>
  <li>Movement of audit logs and security-relevant events from the mobile client and backend into logging/monitoring systems.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5.3 Business Logic</h3>
<p>The OnTime Ethiopia solution implements clearly defined business rules and workflows for the mobile use cases, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>User authentication and session management for mobile logins.</li>
  <li>Selection and presentation of live TV channels, categories, and shorts feeds based on tenant configuration and feature flags.</li>
  <li>Validation logic for user inputs (e.g. login credentials, profile updates) on both client and server.</li>
  <li>Workflows for content availability (e.g. only active channels and READY shorts are shown to end users).</li>
  <li>Exception handling paths for network failures, backend errors, and unsupported content states.</li>
</ul>
<p>Business rules are primarily configured on the backend (e.g. via database configuration, admin UI, and feature flags) and are not hard-coded in a way that requires source code changes for normal operational adjustments. All significant operations (logins, playback requests, admin changes, and background jobs) are expected to be traceable through server-side logs, making the system auditable.</p>

<h3>5.4 Threat Model</h3>
<p>We have prepared a detailed threat model for the mobile application based on industry-recognized methodologies such as STRIDE, OWASP Mobile Top 10, and MITRE ATT&amp;CK. The model includes the following elements:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asset identification:</strong> User credentials, tokens, personal data, content entitlements, configuration, and backend administrative interfaces.</li>
  <li><strong>Threat enumeration:</strong> Network interception, token theft, reverse engineering, API misuse, privilege escalation, and abuse of content endpoints.</li>
  <li><strong>Attack surface mapping:</strong> Mobile app UI, API endpoints, authentication flows, media streaming URLs, and admin/operations interfaces.</li>
  <li><strong>Vulnerability analysis:</strong> Review of authentication, authorization, data storage, transport security, and input validation on both client and server.</li>
  <li><strong>Mitigation strategies:</strong> Use of RBAC, strong authentication, TLS everywhere, rate limiting, secure coding practices, token lifetime management, and comprehensive logging.</li>
</ul>
<p>The threat model deliverables include risk scoring (likelihood and impact), mapping of risks to specific controls, and recommended safeguards to further reduce residual risk, aligned with the INSA Cybersecurity Audit Framework.</p>
